# Packet Context

`PacketContext<TPacket>` is the pooled per-request object used by context-aware handlers in Nalix.Network. It carries the packet, connection, resolved metadata, cancellation token, and a pooled sender that can emit outbound packets using the current handler rules.

## Source mapping

- `src/Nalix.Network/Routing/PacketContext.cs`

## State carried by the context

| Property | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Packet` | Current deserialized packet instance. |
| `Connection` | Current `IConnection`. |
| `Attributes` | `PacketMetadata` resolved for the handler. |
| `CancellationToken` | Request-scoped cancellation token. |
| `SkipOutbound` | Internal flag that skips normal outbound middleware after the handler finishes. |
| `Sender` | Pooled `IPacketSender<TPacket>` resolved during initialization. |

## Pooling behavior

- implements `IPoolable`
- uses `ObjectPoolManager`
- preallocates and sets pool limits based on `PoolingOptions`
- `Initialize(...)` moves the object into the in-use state and rents a `PacketSender<TPacket>`
- `Reset()` returns the rented sender and clears packet, connection, and metadata state
- `Return()` guards against double-return races

## Handler guidance

Use a context-based handler when you need metadata or manual sending:

## Example

```csharp
[PacketOpcode(0x1002)]
public async ValueTask Handle(PacketContext<Handshake> context, CancellationToken ct)
{
    await context.Sender.SendAsync(new Handshake(), ct);
}
```

Returning a packet uses the normal return-type pipeline. Sending through `context.Sender` is the explicit path for immediate or multiple replies.
